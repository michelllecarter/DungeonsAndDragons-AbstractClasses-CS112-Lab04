# DungeonsAndDragons-AbstractClasses-CS112-Lab04

LAB 04 - D&D + Abstract Classes
In this assignment, you'll be getting the back-end started for a Dungeons & Dragons (D&D or DnD) related program. Whether it is simulating an adventure or helping a player create their character, we need it to be flexible for those front-ends and more!

Below is a UML diagram showing the class inheritance to visualize the classes you will build for this project:UML class diagram showing relationship between GameCharacter, Weapon, Elf, and Dwarf classes

Here are the specifics of each class shown above with the requirements to look out for:

Weapon: This is a concrete class used for composition (has-a relationship) in GameCharacter. Here are the specifications:

Create the 4 instance variables from the UML diagram above, with the specified types.
Create all required methods for model classes (constructors, setters, getters, toString, equals)
Error check that ints are >= 0, and Strings are present (not null, length > 0)
GameCharacter: This is an abstract class used as a base class for Elf and Dwarf. Here are the specifications:

Create the 9 instance variables from the UML diagram above, with the specified types.
Create all required methods for model classes (constructors, setters, getters, toString, equals)
This will be a lot of methods! Stay organized and vigilant to avoid copy/paste errors
Error check that ints are >= 0, and Strings are present (not null, length > 0). Also, you can allow Weapon instance variables to be null (this would mean they do not have a weapon in that slot). Make sure to allow this and also deep copy!
Create 2 abstract methods, assist and attack, that both take in a GameCharacter object to interact with. Note the different return types (details below).
Elf and Dwarf: These are concrete derived classes from GameCharacter. Here are the specifications:

No instance variables to create! They have all the data needed in this basic design.
No extra required methods! They inherit all of them to maintain encapsulation.
Implement the two abstract methods, assist and attack, from GameCharacter. Depending on the class, it should have a different functionality that corresponds with the species:
assist will provide a positive action on the given GameCharacter parameter
For Elf, this can be healing (increasing hitPoints left), adding gold, etc.
For Dwarf, this can be adding damage amount to weapon(s), adding to armorClass, etc.
attack will simulate attacking the given GameCharacter parameter
For Elf, this can be decrement hitPoints based off of a characters armorClass and expPoints from a spell cast, for example.
For Dwarf, this can be decrement hitPoints based off of a characters armorClassand Weapon damage from a physical attack, for example.
The above suggestions for assist and attack are just that, suggestions. Feel free to get creative within the design of the classes above. In the future, you could add more data to the classes (such as strength, integrity, etc.) that could be used in modifying the assist and attack methods to add more interesting complexity!

Finally, update your main method and showcase the classes built by creating an object for one character. You can choose which species (Elf or Dwarf) to create, and all instance variables should be set appropriately. Make sure to print out the characters information to verify that all data was stored correctly.

Hacker Challenge
Go crazy with it! Create a new species (Human, Orc, etc.), create a menu to have the user create multiple characters, or even start a small storyline to use that character they created to start a new adventure!
